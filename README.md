# Aethcord
Aethcord is a lightweight client mod focused on simplicity and performance.  
As of right now, Aethcord is in *very* early stages of development, so feel free to join [this server](https://discord.gg/Yphr6WG) for any questions.

# Features
## Spotify Modal
The spotify modal you find on top of the user bar aims to replace the need for having your Spotify client on a monitor.  
The modal lets you view the current song, change volume, play a playlist, switch devices and some other things.  
You can see a video preview of the modal [here](https://discord.coffee/f0f706.mp4).

## Codeblocks
Codeblocks have line numbers (attribution: [noodlebox](https://github.com/noodlebox)) and a `copy` button.
You can see an image preview of the codeblocks [here](https://discord.coffee/cf1cf8.png).
